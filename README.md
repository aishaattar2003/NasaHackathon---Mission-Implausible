### Overview:
- “Flares, Auroras & Me” is a creative digital storybook designed to help middle and high school students explore the fascinating world of space weather. From the dazzling beauty of auroras to the hidden effects of solar storms on our everyday lives.
Through moving animations and interactive storytelling, our project turns scientific concepts into an engaging learning experience that connects students to the science behind the Sun’s activity and its influence on Earth.

### Purpose And Benefits:
Space weather occurs when the Sun releases bursts of energy and charged particles  such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs)  that travel across space and sometimes reach Earth.
Even though these events happen 93 million miles away, they can have powerful effects on our planet. From disrupting GPS and radio communication to creating breathtaking auroras in the night sky.
However, most people aren’t aware of how much the Sun’s activity can impact our daily lives.
Our goal with this project is to:
- Raise awareness about space weather and its real-world effects.
- Educate students about solar phenomena in an easy and fun way.
- Inspire curiosity about space science through visuals, animations, and storytelling.

### Software And Tools used:
- canva for designing animated scenes, illustrations, and data visualizations.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  to structure and style our digital book.
- Turn.js – a JavaScript library that creates a realistic flipbook effect, allowing readers to “turn pages” and interact with the story like a real book
- Pixabay for animated videos.

### Nasa Data And Resources:
Our story draws from credible and educational NASA materials that explain the science of space weather and its effects on Earth.
